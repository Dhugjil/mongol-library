# Mongol Library

This library provides vertical script Mongolian UI elements for Android apps.

This library is usable but still in beta. It can be included in your project from jCenter by adding the following line to your dependancies in your module's build.gradle file:

    dependencies {
        compile 'net.studymongolian:mongol-library:0.2.0'
    }

Documentation will be coming later but you can start with the following main componants:

- `MongolTextView` (a vertical TextView supporting Mongolian Unicode 9.0)
- `MongolLabel` (a light weight TextView for single line labels)
- `MongolEditText` (a vertical EditText that accepts input from system keyboards, including Menksoft and Delehi).

Run the Demo App to see more of what is possible.
